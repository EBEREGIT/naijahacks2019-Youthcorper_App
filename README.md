Providing innovation/solution for Nigeria Youth Corpers in terms of Accommodation, mobility and inter state connect

Accommodation
For those who get posted to states outside their states of residence, accommodation can be a big problem with other basic needs.
Getting a comfortable place on a corperâ€™s salary can be a bit challenging and also getting a smart place to stay before can be a pain in the ass.
It is truly a serious matter. Corps members have been grappling with the problem of accommodation in Nigeria for a long time. It is either a corps member lived in the particular state before youth service posting or he has relations living within the city, or he resorts to squatting with friends
